## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **Zero-Trust serverless web application** built on AWS.  
It implements a "Secure File Vault" where users can safely store, access, and manage critical documents.
The architecture focuses heavily on API security, identity-based access control, frontend protection, data encryption, continuous logging, threat detection, and automated remediation.

By adopting a **defense-in-depth strategy**, this architecture assumes that breaches are inevitable and implements strict controls at every layer—from the user interface delivery to the backend data storage.

---

## 🛡️ Security Architecture & Components

This project implements Zero-Trust principles using a robust stack of AWS services:

### 1️⃣ Edge & Network Layer
- **Amazon CloudFront:** Secure content delivery network (CDN) for delivering the static web application frontend.
- **Amazon S3 (Frontend):** Hosts the static web application assets (HTML, CSS, JS).
- **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall):** Protects CloudFront and API Gateway against Layer 7 attacks, including SQLi, XSS, and rate limiting.

### 2️⃣ Identity & Access Management
- **Amazon Cognito:** Manages user sign-up, sign-in, and provides JWT-based authentication.
- **Amazon API Gateway:** Serves as the backend API entry point, validating Cognito JWTs via Authorizers.

### 3️⃣ Compute Security
- **AWS Lambda:** Serverless backend compute executing with strictly scoped IAM roles.
- **AWS Secrets Manager:** Securely stores and dynamically retrieves application secrets without hardcoding them in the source code.

### 4️⃣ Data Protection
- **Amazon DynamoDB:** Stores file metadata and application state, encrypted at rest using AWS KMS.
- **Amazon S3 (Data Vault):** Securely stores uploaded files. Files are uploaded via presigned URLs and encrypted via KMS. Block Public Access is strictly enforced.

      "Resource": [

          "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
</details>

### 5️⃣ Logging, Monitoring & Threat Detection
- **AWS CloudTrail:** Continuously records all API activity across the AWS account.
- **Amazon GuardDuty:** Provides intelligent threat detection and continuous monitoring of AWS accounts and workloads.
- **AWS Config:** Evaluates and monitors the compliance of AWS resources against security rules.

### 6️⃣ Automated Threat Response
- **Amazon EventBridge:** Routes security findings from GuardDuty and non-compliance events from AWS Config.
- **Amazon SNS:** Sends alerts and notifications regarding security events.
- **Automated Remediation (Lambda):** EventBridge triggers specialized Lambda functions to automatically revert unsafe configurations (e.g., misconfigured S3 bucket policies) or isolate compromised identities.

## 🎯 Zero-Trust Design Principles Applied

- **Never trust network traffic:** WAF strictly filters and monitors incoming requests.
- **Never trust identity without verification:** Cognito and API Gateway ensure all API calls carry a valid, unexpired token.
- **Enforce least privilege:** Every Lambda function and AWS resource operates under strict IAM policies.
- **Encrypt data at rest and in transit:** TLS for all API and frontend traffic, with KMS managing at-rest encryption for S3 and DynamoDB.
- **Continuously monitor for anomalies:** GuardDuty and CloudTrail actively log and analyze environment behavior.
- **Automatically respond to threats:** EventBridge and Remediation Lambdas ensure self-healing capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start / Deployment

> ⚠️ **Note:** Ensure you have the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed before proceeding.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zero-trust-serverless-application.git
   cd zero-trust-serverless-application
   ```

2. **Initialize and Deploy Infrastructure (DEV Environment):**
   ```bash
   cd environments/DEV
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

3. **Configure the Frontend:**
   After Terraform completes, note the generated `Cognito User Pool ID`, `Client ID`, and `API Gateway URL`. Update these values in `scripts/webapp/config.js`.

4. **Upload Frontend to S3:**
   Upload the contents of `scripts/webapp/` to your newly created Frontend S3 bucket.
